# Assignment 1 

# Instructions: 
Time for you to apply knowledge learned from the first two videos!

Use this opportunity to design your first custom webpage. Make use of the techniques discussed in the HTML/CSS (lecture 1) video, as well as the Javascript (lecture 2) video. Upload all relevant files for the sample page, as well as a one page summary explaining what all techniques from the lecture videos were used in your webpage creation.

Because the course is to allow for you to explore and learn ReactJS, the guidelines will be very loose in terms of what is expected for you to do. The intent is that you watch videos and apply what you learned at your own pace, in order to better understand how to use ReactJS and play around more with the material provided. Feel free to refer back to any of the sample reference codebases mentioned in the lecture videos for inspiration if you need ideas.

Make sure to turn in all files as an attached zip file.

#Techniques Applied from Lecture 1 + 2

For the first assignment, I made a website dedicated to capybaras. This website displays a list of reasons capybaras are wonderful, including a link to another website with capybara facts. The website includes a “slideshow” of capybara images that can be changed with the click of a button. From the first lecture video, in capy_files.html, I used the tags for creating numbered lists (<ul></ul>), hyperlinks (<a></a>), and inserting an image (<img>). From the first lecture, I also learned how to use CSS to stylize elements of the website in capy_files.css. I made the bullet and button text in Georgia font using the .body class. I also centered the body of the website (.content class) and centered the button (.center class). From video 3, I applied the techniques for using javascript to make a website interactive. I wrote setImg(), a function that changes the image src when the button is clicked, forming a rudimentary slide show (see capy_files.js). I also referenced w3 schools in addition to the lecture videos.
