# Assignment 1 

# Instructions: 
Time for you to apply knowledge learned from the first two videos!

Use this opportunity to design your first custom webpage. Make use of the techniques discussed in the HTML/CSS (lecture 1) video, as well as the Javascript (lecture 2) video. Upload all relevant files for the sample page, as well as a one page summary explaining what all techniques from the lecture videos were used in your webpage creation.

Because the course is to allow for you to explore and learn ReactJS, the guidelines will be very loose in terms of what is expected for you to do. The intent is that you watch videos and apply what you learned at your own pace, in order to better understand how to use ReactJS and play around more with the material provided. Feel free to refer back to any of the sample reference codebases mentioned in the lecture videos for inspiration if you need ideas.

Make sure to turn in all files as an attached zip file.
